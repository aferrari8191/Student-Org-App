About ChariTi
-------------
ChariTi is a framework built to allow charities to quickly and easily create mobile apps.

Information about ChariTi is available on the [ChariTi Website](http://chariti.mobi/).

Getting Started
---------------

To download your own copy of ChariTi, run the following command in terminal:

	git clone --recursive git@github.com:mcongrove/ChariTi.git

Please include the `--recursive` option to ensure you download all of the submodules!

Code Contribution Practices
---------------------------
* Please _do not_ use the `master` branch; instead, use the next release branch
* Contributions will only be accepted as __pull requests__
* If you plan on taking on an [Issue](https://github.com/mcongrove/ChariTi/issues), leave a comment so no one else duplicates your work
* Be sure to pull the latest code before submitting a pull request; conflicting merges may be rejected
* Poorly written or inefficient contributions will be rejected; it's not personal, we still love you
* If you follow the coding standards established in our existing code, we'll love you even more
	* We've included JS Beautifier in this project; it automatically runs each time you compile to keep code uniform and beautiful
	* Document your code! Other people need to know what's in your head when you write something

Code Documentation
------------------
ChariTi uses JSDuck for documentation, which automatically runs on each compile, so please [install JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) on your machine. Generated documentation is located in the `/docs/documentation/` directory. Simply open the `index.html` page and enjoy.

Where do I start?
-----------------
You can either visit the [Issues](http://github.com/mcongrove/ChariTi/issues) page and pick an un-assigned issue from an upcoming branch, or you can submit a new issue with any features you'd like to see added. We're certainly open to ideas from the community!

If you choose to create your own issue with a new feature, please be sure it isn't already listed. Also, please do not add any tags (priority or issue type). We'll review the issue and tag it appropriately; it's sort of our way of signing off on your idea.

Can I be a contributor?
-----------------------
After you've submitted a couple of pull requests you can ask to be added as a contributor. We'd like to make sure that contributors are following the guidelines first.

What if I want to help with the ChariTi website?
------------------------------------------------
We have a private repository for the ChariTi website. Contact us with more information on how you'd like to help and we can discuss this option.

What is this "Peek" branch?
-----------------------------
The "Peek" branch is ChariTi PEEK, an application which lets you test out your applications quickly and easily with only a JSON configuration file.

You can download PEEK for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chariti-peek/id613335033?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chariti.peek).
